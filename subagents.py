"""
Subagents are a way to delegate tasks to specialized agents.

Advantages include:
- Context isolation: Subagents have their own context and do not share it with the main agent.
- Tool isolation: Subagents can have their own set of allowed tools, which can be useful for security and manageability.
- Parallelization: Subagents can run in parallel, which can improve performance.

For more details, see: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/subagents

This is a Streamlit app version of the subagents example.
